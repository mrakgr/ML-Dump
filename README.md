The stuff I've written over the last four months for machine learning. Some of the early examples might be broken and I can't yet get the GRU and the LSTM to work, but the stuff in the 'utils.fsx' file works nicely and has everything one might need to write a ML algorithm. 'convolutional.fsx' has the things one would need to make a convolutional net. Many examples require the Alea CUDA package and the CUDA 6.5 SDK.

Given the great difficulty of writting the more complex algorithm, right now I am studying Automatic Differentiation.# ML-Dump
